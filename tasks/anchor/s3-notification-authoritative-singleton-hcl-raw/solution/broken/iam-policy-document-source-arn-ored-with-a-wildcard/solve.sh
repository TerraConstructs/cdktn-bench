# Deliberately-BAD reference solution -- HAND-AUTHORED (SCHEMA.md 8.2

#
# ROUND-17 REGRESSION FIXTURE -- the VALUE-LIST launder on the THIRD
# document route, `data "aws_iam_policy_document"`. The `condition` block's
# `values` list holds the wired bucket AND a wildcard; IAM OR-s them, so the
# grant is unconditioned in practice.
#
# THIS ROUTE HAD A SECOND, INDEPENDENT CAUSE and it is why route 3 no longer
# reads the PLAN. `terraform show -json` reports a condition's `values` as
# `{"references": [...]}` with EVERY LITERAL DROPPED -- the wildcard is not
# in `.references` at all -- so a plan-based reader saw a single
# confidently-resolved reference and this scored REWARD 1.0. Route 3 now
# reads the same parsed .tf source the other two routes read
# (`hcl.data_blocks`), where both values still exist.
