# Deliberately-BAD reference solution -- HAND-AUTHORED (SCHEMA.md §8.2
# point 8). EXTRA (non-catch-named) negative fixture, discovered and
# required to score reward 0.0 by gates/oracle_falsifiability.py's own
# "extra broken/ fixture" loop.
#
# ROUND 14 (2026-08-24) -- THE TOPIC HALF of the same hole. Reproduction 3
# of the verifier's blocker: it scored REWARD 1.0 under round 13.
#
# The notification's own `topic_arn` is laundered through an opaque
# expression, so the TOPIC anchor is empty; round 13's
# `count(anchors) != 1` clause then accepted an `aws_sns_topic_policy`
# attached to a DECOY topic on resource TYPE alone. The topic that actually
# receives the delete notifications is left with no resource policy at all,
# and S3 silently drops every publish to it -- the exact damage
# `sns-topic-policy-attached-to-a-decoy-topic-directly` describes, reached
# through the escape hatch rather than through the rule.
#
# There is deliberately NO plan-value route for the topic half (unlike the
# bucket half): a topic ARN is provider-computed, so
# `.values.topic[*].topic_arn` is absent from the plan and there is nothing
# to identify an instance by. An opaque `topic_arn` therefore DENIES, which
# is recorded as a live loud-direction residual in this scenario's spec and
# in policy.rego's own residual list (item 7) rather than being discovered
# later.
