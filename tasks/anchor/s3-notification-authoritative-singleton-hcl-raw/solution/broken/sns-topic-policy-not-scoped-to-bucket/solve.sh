# Deliberately-BAD reference solution -- HAND-AUTHORED (SCHEMA.md §8.2
# point 8). Violates the sns-topic-policy-not-scoped-to-bucket catch (the
# SNS-side mirror of lambda-permission-not-scoped-to-bucket): both
# requirements are otherwise wired correctly (one authoritative
# notification resource, Lambda half fully correct including its scoped
# permission), and an aws_sns_topic_policy resource DOES exist -- but its
# policy document has NO aws:SourceArn-conditioned scoping at all, so it
# grants s3.amazonaws.com sns:Publish unconditionally (any bucket in the
# account, not just this one). Tier-0 still passes
# (sns-topic-policy-exists only checks the resource exists); reward must
# be 0.0 from tier-1 (sns-topic-policy-allows-s3-publish-tf) alone.
