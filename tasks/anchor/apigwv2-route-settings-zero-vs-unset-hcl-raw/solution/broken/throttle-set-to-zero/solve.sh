# Deliberately-BAD reference solution -- HAND-AUTHORED (SCHEMA.md §8.2
# point 8). Reproduces catch `throttle-set-to-zero`: both limits are set to
# `0`, a literal reading of "no burst allowance". `0` is neither
# "unlimited" nor "not configured" -- it rejects every request.
#
# Reward must be 0.0 at TIER 0, via `throttling-rate-is-100` (resolves {0},
# not {100}) and `throttling-burst-is-200` (resolves {0}, not {200}).
