# BROKEN fixture for the `trust-principals-not-split-across-both-roles`
# catch -- HAND-AUTHORED (SCHEMA.md §8.2 point 8).
#
# Two roles still exist, both policies are still attached to both of them,
# and no exclusive-ownership surface is used anywhere -- so every tier-0
# assert passes. What is wrong is the PAIRING the ticket states: the ticket
# asks for `batch-runner`, assumed by ECS tasks, AND `report-writer`,
# assumed by Lambda. Here the FIRST role is made assumable by both ECS
# tasks and Lambda, and the second by Step Functions instead -- so the
# role meant to be assumed by Lambda cannot be assumed by Lambda at all,
# while the flattened union of both roles' trust principals still contains
# both service names.
